/*In order to save disk space, information about student is stored in an
integer variable. If bit number 0 is on then it indicates 1 year student,
bit number 1 to 3 stores IInd year, year and IVh year student respectively.
Bits 4 to 7 store the stream Mechanical, Chemical, Electronics and CS.
Rest of the bits store room number.
Such data for 4 students is stored in the following array:
int data[]={ 273,548,786,1096 };
Write a program that uses this data and displays the information about the
