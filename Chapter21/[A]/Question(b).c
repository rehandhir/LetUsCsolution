/*In an inter-college competition, various sports like cricket,
basketball, football, hockey, lawn tennis, table tennis, carom
and chess are played between different colleges. The information
regarding the games won by a particular college is stored in bit
numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8, respectively of an integer variable
called game. The college that wins in 5 or more than 5 games is
awarded the Champion of Champions trophy. If a number representing
the bit pattern mentioned above is entered through the keyboard then
write a program to find out whether the college won the Champion of
the Champions trophy or not, along with the names of the games won
by the college.*/
