/*Assume that a Master file contains two fields, roll number and name 
of the student. At the end of the year, a set of students join the 
class and another set leaves. A Transaction file contains the roll 
numbers and an appropriate code to add or delete a student.
Write a program to create another file that contains the updated 
list of names and roll numbers. Assume that the Master file and the 
Transaction file are arranged in ascending order by roll numbers.*/
