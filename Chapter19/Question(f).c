/*Write a program to encrypt/decrypt a file using:
(1) Offset cipher: In this cipher each character from the source file 
is offset with a fixed value and then written to the target file.
For example, if character read from the source file is 'A', then 
write a character represented by 'A' +128 to the target file.
(2) Substitution cipher: In this cipher each for character read from 
the source file a corresponding predetermined character is written to 
the target file.
For example, if character 'A' is read from the source file, then a I would 
be written to the target file. Similarly, every 'B' would be substituted 
by '5' and so on.*/
